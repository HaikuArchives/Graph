Graph TODO list

FOR 1.0 FINAL
squash any bug reports
add data plotting (scatter plots)
add coordinate system mapping to allow plotting of any arbitrary coordinate system
save settings
possibly others if some users give me good ideas.
-----
What else I want to do in no particular order

add a step function and a simple way to graph cylic functions.
Add the ability to graph sums
give user feedback on errors in functions
implement graphs with different thicknesses
inequalities
domain and range constraints
undo/redo
user preferences and saving user state
data plotting
histograms
save as encapsulated postscript (eps) and postscript (ps)

This one is seperate because at this point it is more of a pipe dream (since I know nothing about 3d)
3d graphing
